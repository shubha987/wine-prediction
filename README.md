# Wine Quality Prediction

Predicting wine quality using machine learning algorithms based on various features.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using several machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison to determine the best-performing model for predicting wine quality.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics
- Comparing model results to identify the best-performing algorithm
